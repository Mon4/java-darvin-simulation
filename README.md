# Darwin Simulation in Java

This project shows simulation of animals life. They are walking on the map. Every day they move one field, each of them takes selected amount of energy.

On the map you can see animal orientation (direction where it's looking) and animal energy.

When animal is on the field where is grass (green field), animal gets selected amount of energy.

When animal is on the field where is another animal and both animals have enough energy to reproduce, then a new animal is created in the same field. New animal gets half of the parents energy.
